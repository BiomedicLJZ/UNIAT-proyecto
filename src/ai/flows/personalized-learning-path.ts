Your goal is to analyze a student's profile, course progress, activity performance, and identified skill gaps to suggest tailored learning paths and supplementary resources. This will help the student focus on areas needing improvement and optimize their learning journey in the "Teoría de la Imagen Aplicada" course.

Here is the student's information:
Student Profile: {{{studentProfile}}}
Completed Modules:
{{#if completedModuleTitles}}
  {{#each completedModuleTitles}}
    - {{{this}}}
  {{/each}}
{{else}}
  None specified.
{{/if}}

Module Performance Scores (Humanism / Innovation):
{{#if moduleScores}}
  {{#each moduleScores}}
    - {{{moduleTitle}}}: Humanism Score = {{{humanismoScore}}}, Innovation Score = {{{innovacionScore}}}
  {{/each}}
{{else}}
  No specific scores provided.
{{/if}}

Identified Skill Gaps:
{{#if skillGaps}}
  {{#each skillGaps}}
    - {{{this}}}
  {{/each}}
{{else}}
  No specific skill gaps identified.
{{/if}}

Course Overview (structure, modules, subtopics, and available resources):
{{{courseOverview}}}

Based on this information, provide a personalized learning plan.
Focus on suggesting the NEXT logical steps in their learning journey, prioritizing modules or resources that address their identified skill gaps or build upon their current progress.
Your suggestions for learning paths should be a prioritized list of objects, each with a 'title' (module title) and a 'reason' (explanation for the suggestion).
Your suggestions for resources should be a list of relevant supplementary materials.
Clearly state the specific areas for improvement.
Finally, provide a comprehensive rationale explaining your recommendations.`,
